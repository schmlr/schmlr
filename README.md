- 👋 Hi, I’m @schmlr
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, machine learning and modeling, but I recently discovered a passion for front end development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and in particular React - after finishing basic courses in HTML and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ideas and exchanging experiences and tips when it comes to using JavaScript and React.
